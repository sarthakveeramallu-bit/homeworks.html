    Pizza(Italian[pista]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. In Italy, pizza is typically served unsliced, and eaten with a knife and fork.
